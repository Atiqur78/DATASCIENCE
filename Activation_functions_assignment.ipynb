    "Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linearity into the model. They determine whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input, helping the network learn complex patterns. Without activation functions, neural networks would behave like linear regression models, which would limit their ability to handle non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear vs. Non-linear Activation Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Activation Functions: These are functions that produce an output directly proportional to the input, often in the form f(x)=cx, where c is a constant. The primary limitation of linear functions is that stacking multiple linear layers does not increase the complexity of the model; the output remains a linear function of the input. This is insufficient for learning complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear Activation Functions: These are functions that introduce non-linearity, allowing the neural network to learn from data with complex patterns and decision boundaries. Non-linear functions enable neural networks to approximate any continuous function, making them versatile for various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Non-linear Activation Functions are Preferred in Hidden Layers: \n",
    "Non-linear activation functions allow hidden layers to perform complex transformations on the data. With non-linearities, neural networks can model complex patterns by transforming the input through multiple layers. This ability to create complex mappings is essential for tasks such as image classification, language processing, and speech recognition."

    "Non-linearity: Introduces non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns.\n",

    "Advantages of ReLU:\n",
    "Efficient Computation: ReLU is simple, reducing computation time and making it suitable for deep networks.\n",
    "Avoids Vanishing Gradients: For positive values, it has a gradient of 1, which helps maintain gradients during backpropagation, making it effective in deep networks.\n",
    "Challenges with ReLU:\n",

    "Dead Neurons: If the input to ReLU is negative, it outputs zero. Neurons with negative inputs may \"die\" if they output zero throughout the training, causing certain parts of the network to stop learning.\n",

    "Purpose and Characteristics of Tanh:\n",
    "Range: Outputs between -1 and 1, which allows the network to map strongly negative and positive values.\n",
    "Comparison with Sigmoid: Tanh is similar to Sigmoid but is zero-centered, making it better suited for hidden layers where symmetry around zero aids optimization.\n",
    "Vanishing Gradient Issue: Like Sigmoid, Tanh also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, though it’s less severe than in Sigmoid."
